# generativeArtAndDesign
Hello, my name is Tony. I began generative design and experimental art using the Processing language(Java) 10 years ago. Over the last few years I have studied JavaScript 
and began using the Processing p5js library to make art peices on the web. The interactivity of Processing makes it well suited for use in websites and apps, as opposed to stand-
alone applications. 
I have a large collection of generative peices and will begin listing them here.
